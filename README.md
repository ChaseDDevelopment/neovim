# This is my personal NeoVim Configuration

I'll be updating this as I get more comfortable using Neovim and Vim in general. I wanted a centralized place I could pull my config from onto any machine that has neovim. 

## Dependencies

So far the only dependency required is `ripgrep`. I've got instructions for the two main operating systems I use.

To install on MacOS run

```bash
brew install ripgrep
```

and to install on Arch Linux run:

```bash
sudo pacman -S ripgrep
```

## Javascript



I've installed eslinting tools for My React.js projects. This requires the project itself to have eslint installed, and typescript-eslint


## Linters

This is a list of linters that should be installed with Mason. Any item denoted with a `*` should be autoinstalled by this configuration

- ast-grep*
- eslint_d

## Formatters

This is a list of formatters that should be installed with Mason. Any item denoted with a `*` should be autoinstalled by this configuration

- ast-grep*
- black
- prettier
- stylua
